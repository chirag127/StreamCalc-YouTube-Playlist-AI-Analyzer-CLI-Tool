# Security Policy

As a frontend-only application, StreamCalc runs entirely in the user's browser. This significantly reduces the attack surface, as there is no backend server or database to compromise. However, we still take security seriously and are committed to protecting our users.

## Supported Versions

This project is in active development, and security updates will be provided for the latest version only. We encourage all users to stay up-to-date with the most recent release.
